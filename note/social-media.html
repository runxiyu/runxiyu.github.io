		<h1>Social Media</h1>
		<p>Referring to things like Facebook, Twitter, and similar: I do not use social media.  I do not find social media to be meaningful.</p>
		<p>Social media as I understand it is based on &ldquo;microblogging&rdquo;, i.e. short posts about a person's life, thoughts, etc.  Sharing random fun facts about life is fine, but it's really suboptimal for thoughts, especially political ones.  Social media is usually designed in a quick &ldquo;consumption&rdquo;-oriented style, often leading to flamewars instead of in-depth discussions because of its &ldquo;quick&rdquo; and &ldquo;short&rdquo; nature.  Modern social media recommends new posts and people to people based on what they &ldquo;like&rdquo; and &ldquo;boost&rdquo; further creating an information cocoon, &ldquo;shielding&rdquo; them from new ideas, rather than allowing for natural human distribution of good articles.</p>
		<p>Instead, I read and write <a href="/#articles">articles</a> and <a href="/other-articles/">share</a> those that impress me naturally.</p>
		<p>Most popular social media services <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">such as facebook</a> are also nonfree and have extra problems.</p>
		<p>Sharing some fun facts about life is okay.  <a href="/life.html">I do that too.</a>  Just don't use microblogging for should-be-extensive topics and don't use these &ldquo;posts feed&rdquo; things.</p>
