		<h1>The Problem with WeChat, et al.</h1>
		<p>
		WeChat is not a preferred way of contacting me.  <a href="/contact.html">Use these instead</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
		WeChat is a instant messaging program by the Chinese technology giant Tencent.  It is insanely popular in Mainland China.
		</p>

		<p>
		I do not use WeChat when applicable for the following reasons.
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				WeChat's client program is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html">nonfree software</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				Many of WeChat's features are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html">Service as a Software Substitute</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				WeChat's servers are nonfree; the service is centralized.
			</li>
			<li>
				Tencent suspends WeChat accounts for sending &ldquo;politically sensitive chats&rdquo;.
			</li>
			<li>
				Information collected by WeChat is given to the police of the PRC without court warrants.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This list is incomplete.  I can't think of more now, tell me if you know some more.</p>
		<p>Similar problems are present in other popular Instant Messaging services such as <a href="https://stallman.org/whatsapp.html">WhatsApp</a>, <a href="https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html">Discord</a>, Tencent QQ, etc.</p>
