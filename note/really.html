		<h1>``Really'' is a confusing word</h1>
		<p>
		Often times when the word ``really'' is used in as an adverb in an assertion, it may be useful to replace it with ``in some sense'', and seek to ask or clarify ``in what sense''. It shall be recognized that questions that arise from this replacement may be legitimately hard to answer, but it may be still beneficial to consider them.
