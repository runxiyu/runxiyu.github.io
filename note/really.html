		<h1>&ldquo;Really&rdquo; is a confusing word</h1>
		<p>
		Often times when the word &ldquo;really&rdquo; is used in as an adverb in an assertion or proposition, it may be useful to replace it with &ldquo;in some sense&rdquo;, and seek to ask or clarify &ldquo;in what sense&rdquo;. It shall be recognized that questions that arise may be legitimately hard to answer, but it may be still beneficial to consider them.
		</p>
		<p>The same applies for &ldquo;actually&rdquo; and similar words when used this way, though in my experience, people tend to use &ldquo;really&rdquo; this way. I do so too, and I'm trying to get rid of this habit.</p>
