		<h1>Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication</h1>

		<p>This is a public domain dedication based on the <a href="https://wpdd.info/">Worldwide Public Domain Dedication</a> by <a href="https://jxself.org">Jason Self</a>. As I have the increasing demand to formalize my public domain stuff, I am hereby modifying version the WPDD for personal use. I don't think it's a good idea for others to use this, because it hasn't been checked by professional lawyers yet. But anyways, here it is, out of necessity.</p>

Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication

Version 1.

Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
are permitted in any medium without royalty, provided this notice is
preserved. To avoid potential confusion, if you make modifications
please don't call your version Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedicator,
the Worldwide Public Domain Dedication or anything else that might
be confusingly similar. This file is offered as-is, without any
warranty.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically 
confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the 
copyright holder(s) (each and all, a "holder") of an original work of 
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain holders wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work 
for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural 
and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and 
without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, 
incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as 
possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including 
without limitation commercial purposes. These holders may contribute 
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further 
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain 
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the 
use and efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any 
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person or 
organization associating this Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication with 
a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that they are a holder of 
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply 
this Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication to the Work and publicly 
distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of their Copyright 
and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal 
effect of this Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under this 
Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication may be protected by copyright and 
related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). 
Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or 
      performer(s);
 iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
      likeness depicted in a Work;
  iv. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse 
      of data in a Work;
   v. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC 
      of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 
      on the legal protection of databases, and under any national 
      implementation thereof, including any amended or successor 
      version of such directive); 
  vi. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout 
      the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
      implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in 
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, 
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and 
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and 
associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown 
(including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), 
in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum 
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time 
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number 
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without 
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the 
"Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member 
of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and 
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to 
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal 
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the 
public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any 
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, 
then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted 
taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In 
addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby 
grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non 
sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license 
to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) 
in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided 
by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) 
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and 
(iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation 
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The 
License shall be deemed effective as of the date this Runxi Yu's 
Public Domain Dedication was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should 
any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or 
ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or 
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, 
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that they will not (i) 
exercise any of their remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the 
Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with 
respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express 
Statement of Purpose.

4. Waiver of Patent Rights. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 
2, Affirmer acknowledges that the design codes, utility, technical 
figures, charts, methods, processes, and all information related to 
the patent/invention arising out of the Work, the sources, source 
codes, objects, object codes and all system documentation relating 
thereto shall not be confidential and shall be non-proprietary for 
the public worldwide. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in 
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, 
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and 
surrenders all of Affirmer's patent rights and associated claims and 
causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as 
well as future claims and causes of action) throughout the world, 
whether arising under federal law, state law, common law, foreign 
law, or otherwise, for any patent/invention included by Affirmer in 
the Work that are licensable by the Affirmer, both currently owned or 
controlled and acquired or controlled in the future (the "Waiver of 
Patent Rights"). The Waiver of Patent Rights shall not be subject to 
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal 
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the 
public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

5. Patent Grant Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver of Patent 
Rights for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under 
applicable law, then the Waiver of Patent Rights shall be preserved 
to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's 
express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver 
of Patent Rights is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected 
person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non 
exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to Affirmer's patent 
rights, where such license applies only to those patents/inventions 
included by Affirmer in the Work that are licensable by Affirmer, 
both currently owned or controlled and acquired or controlled in the 
future, that are necessarily infringed by making, having made, using, 
selling, offering for sale, importing or transferring the Work, or 
otherwise practicing any method or procedure in any patent/invention 
included by Affirmer in the Work, in whole or in part, alone or in 
combination with or included in any other Work (i) in all territories 
worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law 
or treaty including future time extensions, (iii) in any current or 
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose 
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or 
promotional purposes (the "Patent License"). The Patent License shall 
be deemed effective as of the date this Runxi Yu's Public Domain 
Dedication was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of 
the Patent License for any reason be judged legally invalid or 
ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or 
ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the Patent 
License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that they will not 
(i) exercise any of their patent rights in the Work or (ii) assert 
any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, 
in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

6. Versions. New versions of the Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication
may be released via https://www.andrewyu.org/note/pubdom.html in order
to address issues or concerns that come up. Such new versions shall
remain similar in spirit to provide, as closely as possible, a total
waiver of all rights. Any person or organization receiving a Work
covered by this version of the Runxi Yu's Public Domain Dedication
may elect to apply any later version of the Runxi Yu's Public Domain
Dedication to that Work.

7. Limitations and Disclaimers.

 a. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties 
    of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, 
    accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not 
    discoverable and/or known to Affirmer, all to the greatest extent
    permissible under applicable law.
 b. In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
    writing will Affirmer, any distributor, or any other party related
    to the Work, be liable for damages, including any general, special,
    incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or
    inability to use the work, even if such holder or other party has
    been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other 
    persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including 
    without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in 
    the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for 
    obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights 
    required for any use of the Work.
