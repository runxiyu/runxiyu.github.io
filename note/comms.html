		<h1>Communication Guidelines</h1>
		<p><a href="/contact.html">A few ways to contact me</a></p>
		<p>
		These are some general recommendations that I believe make communicating with me, at least, easier and/or more effective, including communication conventions that make me happier :D.  Please note that what I prefer may not be what others prefer and shall not be treated as a general guideline for communications.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Send complete information.  When telling me something or requesting something, please provide complete background information, knowledge required, and similar things.  As a general rule-of-thumb, the explanation should usually be longer than three sentences or a few paragraphs depending on the complexity of the task at hand.  This prevents back-and-forth communication along the lines of ``and now I need to know ... but you didn't tell me that so can you please give that to me'', generally defragmenting conversations which increases efficiency and comfort.
			</li>
			<li>
			Be direct.  As the sender, do not use polite expressions like ``you did quite well in that presentation'' when in reality, the sender believes that the presentation is not ``quite well''.  Direct critique and suggestions are very welcome here&mdash;politeness is acceptable if it does not interfere with honest conveying of information.
			</li>
			<li>
			<a href="./ask.html">Don't ask to ask.</a>
			</li>
			<li>
			Use plain text email.  Both hard-wrapped and non-hard-wrapped emails are acceptable.
			</li>
			<li>
			Interweave the original message with the response when replying to an email and remove irrelevant parts (i.e. greetings, closings, signatures, etc.) of the quoted original email.
			</li>
		</ol>
