		<h1>Gender-neutral Pronouns</h1>
		<p>You might have seen me use ``their'' instead of ``he'' to refer to myself.  This is not an error.</p>
		<p>Gender is irrelevant in most day-to-day conversations.  Gender-aware pronouns makes us think that there's something inherently different between different genders while in reality these differences are irrelevant to the topic of conversation.</p>
		<p>Therefore, I usually use gender-neutral pronouns unless if gender is important in the context.  The most common is Singular They&mdash;it's basically how ``you'' works in modern English but referring to a third party.  Others include xi/xir, perse/per and even vi/vim (sometimes used among users of the <a href="https://vim.org/">Vim</a> text editor.</p>
