Recently, thanks to labrador, I understand that I'm using the wrong
command (tsign) to sign keys.  I should be using `sign' instead.
At the early stage where I misunderstood the trust levels, I've given a
high trust level (3) to people, giving them the ability to sign keys on
my behalf, which was unintended.

I revoked all the keys, then found that I could not trust them again.
At this point I consider my GPG identity to be broken.  I'll publish a
new key on my website soon.

The new key is located at https://www.andrewyu.org/andrew.asc.  It has
the key ID C906A7F774D14C5CCF89090E01500B118A378124.

If you trust me, you should trust and then sign this key.  Don't tsign
it, that's not a combination of trust and sign, don't nrsign it, don't
do anything out of the ordinary.  Read the manual if you have any
concerns.

Please import https://www.andrewyu.org/revocation.rev.  That is the
revocation certificate for my first key.  Please, spread this around.
The revoked key is at https://www.andrewyu.org/revoked_key.asc. The key
ID is 58BD798121871B71870C27D9978B5891AD3F5986.

I've resigned my recent contacts.  My keyring is at
https://www.andrewyu.org/allkeys.asc.

The moral of the lesson is, be sure to read the manuals and
documentation especially when you're dealing with trust, validity, and
anything important in general.  Don't make the same mistake as me.

Good luck.
