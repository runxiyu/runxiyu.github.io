		<h1>Andrew Yu's Student Government Campaign</h1>
		<p>
		This document is still a work-in-progress.
		</p>
		<p>
		Hi everyone.  I am <a href="https://www.andrewyu.org/">Andrew Yu</a>, a new student at <a href="https://ykpaoschool.cn/">YK Pao School</a>, Year 9.  I have some experience and significant interest in political philosophy.
		</p>
		<p>
		<a href="/school/stugov-proposals.html">I have many proposals for the school.</a>  Take a look at the linked Webpage for the specifics, though in summary: (1) Add drinking water fountains; (2) Draft a rigorous ``legal'' system for within the school for clarity in which behaviors are encouraged, discouraged and punishable; (3) Relax school email rules to allow external emails; (4) Replace fluorescent lighting with LED lighting.  While these proposals and plans are not specific to my campaign, being in the Student Government would make execution of these plans much easier (and would better motivate me to do them, especially for proposal (2) because I'd need to spend time to write a lot of stuff).
		</p>
		<p>
		A note on my view of representative democracy:  Representative democracy, at least generally in politics, is not ``the representatives directly represent the representatives in their opinions''.  Representative democracy is the represented/voters <em>entrusting</em> the representatives/elected to be in the best interests of the represented, and to <em>generally</em>, not directly, represent their direct interests.  Here's an example: The represented may generally want to get rid of tech-handins (ultimately we'd just have more flexible time for our work, which is nice, and the people who want to play games all night get to play games all night).  But a representataive may consider possible problems (e.g. people playing games all night, tired during the next day, unable to listen to anything that they hear) and decide not to present or vote for such a bill in Student Government.  (In a near-perfect representative democracy representatives will clearly communicate these ideas to the represented, and have a micromanaged consensus with the represented, which is what a representative should go for but is unlikely to be actually realized.)
		</p>
		<p>
		If you believe that I will be a contribution for the environment of the school by being in the Student Government, that my proposals make sense, please consider voting for me as it would make what I want to do easier.  Do note that there is an oppurtunity cost voting for me&mdash;you now cannot vote for someone else, so, cast your vote carefully, I guess.
		</p>
		<p>
		(Note to self: plurality voting is broken in modern politics but less so when selecting based on trust in the candidates' ability.  Consider proposing an alternative voting system such as Instant Runoff or Approval Voting. See §11¶2.)
