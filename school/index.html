		I understand that gossip is a natural part of life at high school, but please don't go too far with that.  Especially for gossip that's unevidenced/unevidented and ``let's just say that and look at people's reactions'': honestly these are meaningless.  Remember the ``no-harm principle''?  <em>Excessive gossip twists normal friendships and make them awkward, distorted, and unnatural.</em>  In some sense it has became, hopefully unintentionally, a social way to discourage friendship, communication and, I guess, compassion between individuals of different genders.  Conclusively: Excessive gossip should be avoided.
