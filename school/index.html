		<h1>Andrew Yu's School Stuff</h1>
		<p>Hi.  This page is only for those at my school.  Some of these are just my reminders.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Student government election upcoming at the end of September.  Sign up before September 15th.</li>
			<li><a href="cardiology.html">Cardiology introduction</a>, not constantly updated.  Poke me if you want an updated version.</li>
			<li>Three detentions of the same kind results in a principal's detention.  Missing any detention results in a principal's detention.</li>
			<li style="background-color: yellow;">Too much gossip is everywhere.  Please calm down a bit if that's you&mdash;you're ruining friendships.  Seriously!</li>
