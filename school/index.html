		<h1>Andrew Yu's School Stuff</h1>
		<p>Hi.  This page is only for those at my school.  Some of these are just my reminders.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Student government election upcoming at the end of September.  Sign up before September 15th.</li>
			<li><a href="cardiology.html">Cardiology introduction</a>, not constantly updated.  Poke me if you want an updated version.</li>
			<li>Three detentions of the same kind results in a principal's detention.  Missing any detention results in a principal's detention.</li>
			<li style="background-color: yellow;">Too much gossip is everywhere.  Please calm down a bit if that's you&mdash;you're ruining friendships.  Seriously!</li>
			<li>Math homework, at least for Ms. Lisa Liu's class, is extremely easy.  I wouldn't expect anything harder for other classes in Year 9.  It's literally just vector scaling, vector arithmetic (not even real matrix multiplication), and what... basic linear transformations (i.e. enlargement, stretching, rotation, reflection), translations, and for those who choose to do more than necessary homework (who of course don't have trouble with required homework), basic algebra questions that gives full marks for simply raising an example for a hypothesis instead of proving the hypothesis?  (Ask Me, s22537 Andrew, for a copy.)<br />Yes, each packet is like 15-pages long, but it's literally just a minute per page.  It's really not much.  Heh, you can ask me for some harder ones (a.k.a. Zhongkao Math).  If you can't do that quickly, well that's normal.  If your homework is differnt, tell me.  If you're really having a hard time with math, I'm happy to help (and you should also ask your teacher).  I'm usually at the library during lunchtime.<br />Oh the proof thing is for the optional investigation/whatever-that-is-actually-called packet, which you should ask your teacher for.  Try to prove <span><i>D</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>D</i>(<i>x</i> + 9<sup><i>n</i></sup>)∀(<i>x</i>, <i>n</i>) ∈ ℤ<sup>+</sup></span>, rather than just giving two examples.</li>
		</ul>

(The following message is harsh and somewhat "irritating".  Sorry but this is
how I'm like when it comes to this.)

So I was doing some testing with my WeChat scripts when I found this:

Welcome to the neuroscience club！🥹
We provide you with the perfect, scientific solution for 
-emotional damages 
-love problems 
-sleep problems 
-procrastination 
-problems with your homework
绝对靠谱 科学依据 大家快来！

There is no perfect, scientific solution for any of these problems.  I
doubt that such a solution exists for *any* problem, let alone these
long-unsolved neuroscience ones.  If you do have one, you should publish
a paper.

I understand that this is an exaggeration and you're trying to get more
people in to this wonderful club.  But explicitly putting “绝对靠谱”,
“科学依据”, "perfect" and "scientific" there, is to me, dangerously
close to deceptive advertising and shall not be accepted.  Please refrain
from such behaviors.</pre>
