		I understand that gossip is a natural part of life at high school, but please don't go too far with that.  Especially for gossip that's unevidenced/unevidented and ``let's just say that and look at people's reactions'': honestly these are meaningless.  Remember the ``no-harm principle''?  <em>Excessive gossip twists normal friendships and make them awkward, distorted, and unnatural.</em>  In some sense it has became, hopefully unintentionally, a social way to discourage friendship, communication and, I guess, compassion between individuals of different genders.  Conclusively: Excessive gossip should be avoided.

			<li>Student government election upcoming at the end of September.  Sign up before September 15th.</li>
			<li><a href="cardiology.html">Cardiology introduction</a>, not constantly updated.  Poke me if you want an updated version.</li>
			<li>Three detentions of the same kind results in a principal's detention.  Missing any detention results in a principal's detention.</li>
			<li>Math homework, at least for Ms. Lisa Liu's class, is extremely easy.  I wouldn't expect anything harder for other classes in Year 9.  It's literally just vector scaling, vector arithmetic (not even real matrix multiplication), and what... basic linear transformations (i.e. enlargement, stretching, rotation, reflection), translations, and for those who choose to do more than necessary homework (who of course don't have trouble with required homework), basic algebra questions that gives full marks for simply raising an example for a hypothesis instead of proving the hypothesis?  (Ask Me, s22537 Andrew, for a copy.)<br />Yes, each packet is like 15-pages long, but it's literally just a minute per page.  It's really not much.  Heh, you can ask me for some harder ones (a.k.a. Zhongkao Math).  If you can't do that quickly, well that's normal.  If your homework is differnt, tell me.  If you're really having a hard time with math, I'm happy to help (and you should also ask your teacher).  I'm usually at the library during lunchtime.<br />Oh the proof thing is for the optional investigation/whatever-that-is-actually-called packet, which you should ask your teacher for.  Try to prove <span><i>D</i>(<i>x</i>) = <i>D</i>(<i>x</i> + 9<sup><i>n</i></sup>)∀(<i>x</i>, <i>n</i>) ∈ ℤ<sup>+</sup></span>, rather than just giving two examples.</li>
