(The following message is harsh and somewhat "irritating".  Sorry but this is
how I'm like when it comes to this.)

So I was doing some testing with my WeChat scripts when I found this:

Welcome to the neuroscience club！🥹
We provide you with the perfect, scientific solution for 
-emotional damages 
-love problems 
-sleep problems 
-procrastination 
-problems with your homework
绝对靠谱 科学依据 大家快来！

There is no perfect, scientific solution for any of these problems.  I
doubt that such a solution exists for *any* problem, let alone these
long-unsolved neuroscience ones.  If you do have one, you should publish
a paper.

I understand that this is an exaggeration and you're trying to get more
people in to this wonderful club.  But explicitly putting “绝对靠谱”,
“科学依据”, "perfect" and "scientific" there, is to me, dangerously
close to deceptive advertising and shall not be accepted.  Please refrain
from such behaviors.
