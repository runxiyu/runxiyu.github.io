		<h1>On Jokes about Suicide</h1>
		<p class="copyright">
		People really need to stop joking about suicide. Stop clowning around with statements like "Iâ€™m gonna kill myself" "I will commit suicide" or "I want to jump off a building". It is not cool to tell others you want to end your own life for something of little importance that may have inconvenienced or bothered you. It is extremely disrespectful to the hundreds of thousands of people who loose their lives because of suicide and is inconsiderate to people who are really suffering from mental health issues. Joking about suicide is not okay, grow up and find other ways to deal with and express your stress or frustrations.
