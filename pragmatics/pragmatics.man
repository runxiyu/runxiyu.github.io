       Free Software is undoubtably a good thing for society.  However, modern
       computer users are stuck in the proprietary "ecosystem" for  historical
       reasons.   This document describes the author's viewpoint of using pro-
       prietary platforms to spread the ideas of Free Software.

       This document describes the author's viewpoint.  This does  not  repre-

       Readers of this memo probably understand the ideals of the  Free  Soft-
       ware  Movement, and avoid proprietary software when possible.  However,
       as most outsiders are unaware and are deeply buried inside the  propri-
       etary dystopia created by mostly multibillion-dollar technology coorpo-
       rations, our methods of communicating with the masses are ineffective.


       In February 2022, the author decided to adjust his dogma, and permitted
       limited  usage  of nonfree chat platforms to hopefully spread our ideas
       to the general public.  This was attempted by registering a Discord ac-
       count,  creating a Guild called "Free Software Introductions", and set-
       ting up a basic Discord-to-IRC relay to #fsi on  both  irc.andrewyu.org
       and irc.libera.chat.


       One  of  the  communities  that he knows about, the VF-Technic Minetest
       community, primarily uses Discord as a means of communication by  plays
       not in-game.  As the users inside are Minetest players, a Free Software
       voxel sandbox game, similar to but much more flexible  and  freedom-re-
       specting  than  Minecraft, it is believed that the users have some con-
       tact with Free Software, although they might not understand the freedom
       part  of  the  issue,  i.e.  they  might  be thinking in terms of "open
       source" instead.  After sharing  the  invite  link  in  the  VF-Technic
       Guild, some people joined, and we've partially converted two users.

       Two users is definitely few, but it sets a start and an example for how
       freedom can be spread.


       There are numerous free replacements to proprietary  services  such  as
       Discord, such as Internet Relay Chat, the Extensible Messaging and Pre-
       sense Protocol, the Matrix protocol, and email.  As Free  Software  ac-
       tivists,  we  generally  prefer  these protocols over nonfree services.
       This section explains the reasons to consider nonfree services and pro-
       tocols.


       Generally,  users on IRC and XMPP have a fair understanding of the Free
       Software Movement, and it is quick and easy to inform them what we mean
       by  "free",  "the  four freedoms", and similar ideas.  For users on the
       Libera Chat IRC network, which by far has the most users  of  any  net-
       work,  it is exceptionally easy to introduce a user into the #fsf chan-
       nel for discussions with people supporting Free Software.   Introducing
       ignorant users on these protocols and platforms are a day-to-day simple
       task.


       Furthermore, the amount of users we can reach on  these  protocols  are
       rather  limiting.   Libera has around forty thousand users according to
       the UUSSEERRSS command, and considering the fact that around  90%  of  these
       people aren't ignorant, there isn't much we can do.


       Matrix  users,  in particular users of the matrix.org homeserver, typi-
       cally know but don't completely understand Free Software.  Rather  than
       using  Matrix IDs to identify users, the Matrix specification specifies
       that third-party platform identities, such as email and GitHub, are how
       users  should  be  referenced  both  internally by servers and shown to
       other users.  This is obviously an increadibly foolish idea, especially
       considering  the  use  of centralized identity servers (similar to X509
       certificate authorities) for 3PIDs.  These are our first  targets,  but
       these should also be easy to get the idea across.


       It is true that Libera Chat and similar IRC networks, though multi-cen-
       tered in a technical way (i.e. multiple IRC servers form  an  IRC  net-
       work),  the  network  is politically centralized, controlled by one en-
       tity, Libera.  The Internet Relay Chat  server-to-server  protocol  im-
       plies  that servers fully trust each other and are expected to not send
       damaging commands, which in turn implies full trust between server  op-
       erators, no federation, and political centralization.  The privacy pol-
       icy and network policy of Libera Chat are in the author's opinion  non-
       intrusive,  therefore the use of which is acceptable and is promoted by
       the FSF.  (Obviously, most methods of using IRC do not involve  nonfree
       software.)


       Nevertheless,  those that have never touched Free Software are often on
       giant proprietary platforms, and take these  as  universal  methods  of
       communication.   Many  people  go  months before checking their mailbox
       (physical or electronic), refuse to use XMPP or IRC for its age.


       An alternative protocol, Internet Delay Chat, is being developed.


       There is one special case where using some nonfree software,  and  even
       urging  others  to use it, can be a positive thing. That's when the use
       of the nonfree software aims directly at putting an end to the  use  of
       that  very  same nonfree software.[RMSGP]  The author believes that the
       following fall within this scope:


       +o   Developing a free program that  requires  nonfree  environments  to
           bootstrap;

       +o   To  spread awareness of software freedom issues to users in nonfree
           environments.



       As almost all types of programming can be done on most types of BSD and
       GNU  operating  systems,  the author hasn't found any software that fit
       this category.  Extending the interpretation allos  for  using  nonfree
       software's behavior as a reference in Free Software development, though
       an arguable programming practice, may help the community to progress by
       understanding common features that users of nonfree services use.


       The  latter  is  more  interesting,  as  explained above our methods of
       spreading awareness is limited.

       Activists MMUUSSTT NNOOTT list such nonfree services in "Contact  Information"
       pages  on their website or similar sources, unless followed by a expla-
       nation that the purpose of the nonfree platform is to  introduce  users
       thereof  onto  free protocols and to eventually exterminate the nonfree
       platform.  Whenever these references to nonfree platforms  appear,  the
       author  MMUUSSTT  present  free methods of communication.  Activists SSHHOOUULLDD
       pragmatically use as many of the popular free protocols as possible, to
       ensure  that oppurtunities of introductions are not lost.  In cases in-
       volving competition between free and nonfree protocols  and  platforms,
       ethical  concerns  (i.e.  enabling talking to a new user on any ethical
       platform) MMUUSSTT take precedence over technical concerns (such as dislik-
       ing the XMPP protocol for its inefficent use of XML) whenever possible.


       Communities for introducing users to Free Software on nonfree platforms
       MMUUSSTT be bridged to a free protocol in some obvious  way,  in  order  to
       minimize  the usage of nonfree platforms even for the purpose of commu-
       nicating ideology to new users and allow members of the  Free  Software
       community  refusing to use nonfree platforms in any way to participate.
       Usages of nonfree platforms,  besides  part  of  the  user-introduction
       process that must happen on the nonfree platform, SSHHOOUULLDD be avoided.


       For  example,  the  author created a Discord Guild called Free Software
       Introductions, which is one-way-puppeted to #fsi  on  irc.andrewyu.org,
       which  is then one-way-puppeted to Libera.  The relay system is sort-of
       messed up, but it's working.  Inviting new users to it via https://dis-
       cord.gg/7CYp7ntww7  <https://discord.gg/7CYp7ntww7> is good, but as the
       author has made his own sacrifice already, there  exists  no  need  for
       other  existing  Free  Software activists to join and use it instead of
       IRC.

       The old and centralized nature of IRC, the insane  3PID  recommendation
       of Matrix, the bad routing and efficency of XMPP, and the lack of docu-
       mentation on PSYC, has led us to develop a new protocol, Internet Delay
       Chat[IDC],  which  aims  to  be  free, modern (i.e. support for channel
       groups and shared permission sets, non-text data with MIME types), sane
       (i.e. TCP, UDP and SCTP-based, instead of HTTP POST APIs) and simple.
