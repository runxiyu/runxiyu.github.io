Abstract

   Free Software is undoubtably a good thing for society.  However,
   modern computer users are stuck in the proprietary "ecosystem" for
   historical reasons.  This document describes the author's viewpoint
   of using proprietary platforms to spread the ideas of Free Software.

Status of This Memo

1.  Introduction

   Readers of this memo probably understand the ideals of the Free
   Software Movement, and avoid proprietary software when possible.
   However, as most outsiders are unaware and are deeply buried inside
   the proprietary dystopia created by mostly multibillion-dollar
   technology coorporations, our methods of communicating with the
   masses are ineffective.

   In February 2022, the author decided to adjust his dogma, and
   permitted limited usage of nonfree chat platforms to hopefully spread
   our ideas to the general public.  This was attempted by registering a

   Discord account, creating a Guild called "Free Software
   Introductions", and setting up a basic Discord-to-IRC relay to #fsi
   on both irc.andrewyu.org and irc.libera.chat.

   One of the communities that he knows about, the VF-Technic Minetest
   community, primarily uses Discord as a means of communication by
   plays not in-game.  As the users inside are Minetest players, a Free
   Software voxel sandbox game, similar to but much more flexible and
   freedom-respecting than Minecraft, it is believed that the users have
   some contact with Free Software, although they might not understand
   the freedom part of the issue, i.e. they might be thinking in terms
   of "open source" instead.  After sharing the invite link in the VF-
   Technic Guild, some people joined, and we've partially converted two
   users.

2.  Justification

   Two users is definitely few, but it sets a start and an example for
   how freedom can be spread.

   There are numerous free replacements to proprietary services such as
   Discord, such as Internet Relay Chat, the Extensible Messaging and
   Presense Protocol, the Matrix protocol, and email.  As Free Software
   activists, we generally prefer these protocols over nonfree services.
   This section explains the reasons to consider nonfree services and
   protocols.

   Generally, users on IRC and XMPP have a fair understanding of the
   Free Software Movement, and it is quick and easy to inform them what
   we mean by "free", "the four freedoms", and similar ideas.  For users
   on the Libera Chat IRC network, which by far has the most users of
   any network, it is exceptionally easy to introduce a user into the
   #fsf channel for discussions with people supporting Free Software.
   Introducing ignorant users on these protocols and platforms are a
   day-to-day simple task.

   Furthermore, the amount of users we can reach on these protocols are
   rather limiting.  Libera has around forty thousand users according to
   the USERS command, and considering the fact that around 90% of these
   people aren't ignorant, there isn't much we can do.

   Matrix users, in particular users of the matrix.org homeserver,
   typically know but don't completely understand Free Software.  Rather
   than using Matrix IDs to identify users, the Matrix specification
   specifies that third-party platform identities, such as email and
   GitHub, are how users should be referenced both internally by servers
   and shown to other users.  This is obviously an increadibly foolish
   idea, especially considering the use of centralized identity servers
   (similar to X509 certificate authorities) for 3PIDs.  These are our
   first targets, but these should also be easy to get the idea across.

   It is true that Libera Chat and similar IRC networks, though multi-
   centered in a technical way (i.e. multiple IRC servers form an IRC
   network), the network is politically centralized, controlled by one
   entity, Libera.  The Internet Relay Chat server-to-server protocol
   implies that servers fully trust each other and are expected to not
   send damaging commands, which in turn implies full trust between
   server operators, no federation, and political centralization.  The
   privacy policy and network policy of Libera Chat are in the author's
   opinion non-intrusive, therefore the use of which is acceptable and
   is promoted by the FSF.  (Obviously, most methods of using IRC do not
   involve nonfree software.)

   Nevertheless, those that have never touched Free Software are often
   on giant proprietary platforms, and take these as universal methods
   of communication.  Many people go months before checking their
   mailbox (physical or electronic), refuse to use XMPP or IRC for its
   age.

   An alternative protocol, Internet Delay Chat, is being developed.

   There is one special case where using some nonfree software, and even
   urging others to use it, can be a positive thing.  That's when the
   use of the nonfree software aims directly at putting an end to the
   use of that very same nonfree software.[RMSGP] The author believes
   that the following fall within this scope:

   *  Developing a free project that requires nonfree environments to
      bootstrap;
   *  To spread awareness of software freedom issues to users in nonfree
      environments.

   As almost all types of development can be done on most types of BSD
   and GNU operating systems, the author hasn't found any software that
   fit this category.  Extending the interpretation allos for using
   nonfree software's behavior as a reference in Free Software
   development, though an arguable programming practice, may help the
   community to progress by understanding common features that users of
   nonfree services use.

   The latter is more interesting, as explained above our methods of
   spreading awareness is limited.

3.  Action Procedure

   Activists MUST NOT list such nonfree services in "Contact
   Information" pages on their website or similar sources, unless
   followed by a explanation that the purpose of the nonfree platform is
   to introduce users thereof onto free protocols and to eventually
   exterminate the nonfree platform.  Whenever these references to
   nonfree platforms appear, the author MUST present free methods of
   communication.  Activists SHOULD pragmatically use as many of the
   popular free protocols as possible, to ensure that oppurtunities of
   introductions are not lost.  In cases involving competition between
   free and nonfree protocols and platforms, ethical concerns (i.e.
   enabling talking to a new user on any ethical platform) MUST take
   precedence over technical concerns (such as disliking the XMPP
   protocol for its inefficent use of XML) whenever possible.

   Communities for introducing users to Free Software on nonfree
   platforms MUST be bridged to a free protocol in some obvious way, in
   order to minimize the usage of nonfree platforms even for the purpose
   of communicating ideology to new users and allow members of the Free
   Software community refusing to use nonfree platforms in any way to
   participate.  Usages of nonfree platforms, besides part of the user-
   introduction process that must happen on the nonfree platform, SHOULD
   be avoided.

   For example, the author created a Discord Guild called Free Software
   Introductions, which is one-way-puppeted to #fsi on irc.andrewyu.org,
   which is then one-way-puppeted to Libera.  The relay system is sort-
   of messed up, but it's working.  Inviting new users to it via
   https://discord.gg/7CYp7ntww7 (https://discord.gg/7CYp7ntww7) is
   good, but as the author has made his own sacrifice already, there
   exists no need for other existing Free Software activists to join and
   use it instead of IRC.

4.  Technical Limitations

   The old and centralized nature of IRC, the insane 3PID recommendation
   of Matrix, the bad routing and efficency of XMPP, and the lack of
   documentation on PSYC, has led us to develop a new protocol, Internet
   Delay Chat[IDC], which aims to be free, modern (i.e. support for
   channel groups and shared permission sets, non-text data with MIME
   types), sane (i.e.  TCP, UDP and SCTP-based, instead of HTTP POST
   APIs) and simple.
