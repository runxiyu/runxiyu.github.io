		<h1>Andrew Yu's Microblog</h1>
		<p id="intro">
		This is my <i>microblog</i>, a place for me to jot down random thoughts that I want to keep, but are too small enough to constitute a real article/post.

		As much as I believe in determinism, I do not believe that humans have capacity to pre-determine their own fate.

		My world is still of metapohrical illusions. I need to learn to be afraid of romanticized narratives and perspectives. However, it is apparently hard to do so&mdash;I sink into romantic words that create a color filter in my perception, they make reality look so beautiful, so... ``sweet'', moving me further away from what reality really is.

		I'm probably not the only one who has these dangerous/harmful/unhelpful thoughts:<br />
		How different, or perhaps ``better' could my life be, if I could go back to the start of Year 9, and make different decisions? Perhaps that would mean choosing something other than IGCSE History. Or perhaps that means... when that was still possible, let my yearn and longing for intimacy with trusted people to discuss philosophy and science with, stay undeveloped.<br />
		Perhaps I could have became a happy person. The me of the present could never know.

		To what extent is "it sets a precedent" a concern that justifies or warrants declining a request that is on its own, appropriate?

		I hereby discard the structuralist view that people are composed of the opposing parts "benign" and "malicious". These simple and perhaps judgemental concepts are insufficient in face of the complexity of the human condition.
