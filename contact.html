		<h1>Contact Andrew Yu</h1>
		<p>There are many ways to contact me.  None of these require proprietary software.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Electronic mail to <code>andrew</code> AT <code>andrewyu</code> DOT <code>org</code>.  (Please sign and encrypt messages if possible.  See below.)</li>
			<li>Electronic mail to <code>andrew-public-inbox</code> AT <code>andrewyu</code> DOT <code>org</code> for things that are to be discussed publicly but are addressed to me.  <a href="https://mail.andrewyu.org/pipermail/andrew-public-inbox">See archives.</a></li>
			<li>Paper mail to <code>Yu, Andrew (Run Xi 于润熙, s22537%29, 1800, Lane 900 North Sanxin Road, Songjiang District, Shanghai, China 201620</code>.  (Note that I do not check school mail daily and I can't check it during vacations.  Please do not attempt to use OpenPGP encryption or such for paper mail.)</li>
			<li>Internet Relay Chat to <code>Andrew</code> on <a href="https://irc.libera.chat/">Libera.Chat</a> and <code>irc.andrewyu.org</code>.</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://git.andrewyu.org/andrew/simp.git/">Simple Internet Mail Protocol</a> mail to <code>andrew</code> AT <code>andrewyu</code> DOT <code>org</code>.
				<br/>
				SIMP, and my implementation <a href="https://git.andrewyu.org/andrew/ememo.git/about/">Ememo</a> are under active development and are extremely incomplete.  <strong>This is not a reliable channel for communication.</strong>  And because the protocol specification is updated slower than the testbed implementation, please refer to the latest Ememo implementation when sending messages.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p><a href="/note/wechat.html">Please do not contact me via WeChat.  (Same for other proprietary stuff like Discord.)</a><br /><a href="/note/social-media.html">I do not use modern &ldquo;social media&rdquo; like Twitter or Weibo, here's why.</a><br /><a href="/note/comms.html">Please follow these communication guidelines when applicable.</a><br /><a href="/school/contact.html">If you are a student of YK Pao School and would like to contact me for school-related purposes, use this.</a></p>
		<h2 id="pgp">OpenPGP</h3>
		<p>If you have no idea what these mean, read <a href="https://emailselfdefense.org/">the Email Self Defense tutorial</a>.</p>
		<p>Usually, electronic mail that I send are signed with my OpenPGP key.  Please use OpenPGP when contacting me through electronic mail.  The following are available.</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.andrewyu.org/pgp/andrew-ecc.asc">My ECC key</a> (recommended)</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.andrewyu.org/pgp/andrew.asc">My RSA key</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.andrewyu.org/pgp/allkeys.asc">My keyring of friends</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>In order to verify the authenticity of the key, check if you've actually downloaded these keys from <code>andrewyu.org</code>, and also check the fingerprints with me elsewhere (email, IRC, in real life, etc) before trusting or signing it.</p>
		<p>Once confirmed, please sign and share my key in order to build the OpenPGP Web of Trust.</p>
