		<h1>Reclaiming "他" as a gender-inclusive pronoun</h1>
		<p>Article ID: 23</p>
<p>tl;dr: ``他'' uses the ``人'' (person) radical, and should cover all
people, because not all people are male.</p>
<p>In contemporary English, the traditional plaural pronoun ``they'' is
often used as a gender-inclusive singular pronoun, alongside the
feminine singular ``she'' and the masculine singular ``he''. However, there
is no equivalent in Chinese. ``他'' is considered a masculine pronouns in
contemporary Chinese, despite its ``人'' radical and its history of
traditionally being a gender-inclusive pronoun until the 1920s. This
article argues for the reclaiming of ``他'' as a gender-inclusive
pronoun.</p>
<p>Prior to the May Fourth Movement and the broader New Culture
Movement, ``他'' was a generic pronoun for all entities, including people
of any gender, and inanimate objects. In the movements’ efforts to
``modernize'' the Chinese language and culture, a seperate feminine
pronoun ``她'' was created by the poet and linguist 刘半农, becoming an
established linguistic norm after the Chinese Civil War. (A seperate
``它'' was created for inanimate objects; however this has little
relevance to the arguments in this article.)</p>
<p>A distinct feminine pronoun ``她'' along with ``他'' being a masculine
pronoun poses three problems: (1) the annoyances caused by the lack of a
inclusive placeholder pronoun, (2) the reinforcement of gender binary
normatives and the lack of a neutral pronoun, and (3) the
marginalization of the feminine from the concept of personhood.</p>
<p>When referring to a placeholder of unknown gender in contemporary
English, singular they pronouns are often used, such as in ``someone left
their laptop here''. Such colloquial conversations are generally
aproblematic as all normative third-person pronouns in Mandarin sound
the same: tā. However, in written contexts, many use ``他/她'' ressembling
``he/she''. Aside from how this reinforces gender binary and alienates
women (see the next two paragraphs), it is visually unappealing (as
half-width slashes look particularly distinct from full-width CJK
ideographs and break typographical uniformity) and adds unnecessary
syntactic sugar.</p>
<p>Individuals who are not comfortable with any gendered pronoun (such
as me until <a
href="https://git.andrewyu.org/andrew/www.git/commit/note/pronouns.html?id=ce4cd5fd7b3fd19d8effd3e18f5c71dadfc5874e">this
commit</a>) often prefer singular they pronouns. (I do not wish to turn
this article into a detailed discussion of non-binary gender, please
read Leah Rowe’s article ``<a
href="https://vimuser.org/pronouns.html">Better respect for non-binary
people, in defense of human rights</a>'' if this concept seems
unfamiliar.) The status quo of ``她'' being solely a femine pronoun and
``他'' being solely a masculine pronoun reinforces gender binary and
leaves no gender-neutral/inclusive pronoun for non-binary people who
would prefer such pronouns.</p>
<p>The more fundamental issue with ``他'' as a masculine pronoun lies in
its characater composition and etymology. ``他'' is a compound character
consisting of a ``人'' (person) radical and ``也'', while ``她'' consists of a
``女'' (female) radical and ``也''. Limiting ``他'' as a male pronoun assumes
the male gender as dominant in ``people'', and marginalizes other genders,
most prominently the female gender, as groups distinct from ``people''.
This aligns with the development of the ``她'' pronoun as a distinct
subset of what used to be covered by ``他''. I believe that a character’s
composition should not be deceptive to its meaning, and therefore, the
``他'' with the ``人'' radical should describe any person, not just any male
person.</p>
<p>Those who prefer a unique masculine pronoun may choose to use one
with a ``男'' (male) radical instead. While ``男也'' has not been given a
unicode code-point yet, I find this solution to be much more ideal than
stereotypical generalizationis with ``他''.</p>
