		<h1>Democracy: Fundementals (Unfinished)</h1>
		<p><i>Unless otherwise specified, ``democracy'' in this article refers to representative democracy.  ``Country'' can additionally refer to other regions that have people and its own policies, such as a state, provinces in some countries, etc.</i></p>
		<p>
		We usually think of ``democracy'' as people influencing the policies of the country by electing trustworthy experts that serve their interst to make actual decisions.  This type of democracy, representative democracy, has evolved from direct democracy aging back two thousand years ago as created by Athens in Greece.  Representative democracy is more scalable than direct democracy and also avoids some forms of populism and uninformed decisions as its the experts in the field that are making the actual policies.
		</p>
		<p>
		There's another part of democracy, that we take for granted and is an outcome of democracy <span style="color: red; font-size: 50%;">(Proof!)</span> but is often ommited when talking about democracy: liberty.
