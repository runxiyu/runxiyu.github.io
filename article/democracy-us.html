		<h1>Democracy: The US Constitution (Unfinished)</h1>
		<p>
		When people talk about democracies, it's common to think of the US Constitution as the ``defining point of democracy''.  While the US is the first modern democracy, its laws is far from perfect.  In fact, it may be one of the worst of modern time!  I will briefly go through the following.

		A near-ideal democracy would have a roughly linear positive correlation between the fraction of voters who support a policy and the possibility of the policy being passed in the legislature.  But in the US, the line is flat at about 30%.  A representative democracy wouldn't have a perfect correlation, because the general public is unable to be informed on all topics; fluctuations are normal.  But <em>a flat line</em> means that the opinions of the people don't matter at all.  This does not make sense in any type of democracy.
