<p>When the Ship of Theseus has its all parts replaced one after another
until no original components remain, is it still the Ship of Theseus, or
is it a new ship altogether? Similarly, when most of my body cells are
constantly renewed, coupled with my mindset being continuously
transformed by new information and acquaintances, am I still the same
person as the ten-year-old “me”?</p>
<p>This essay explores the continued <em>personal</em> identity from two
perspectives. First is the concept of <em>individuality</em>, i.e.
whether there is a delimited, discrete, and cohesive existence of “me”
in the first place. An affirmative answer positing the delineated
boundary of individual existence is the prerequisite to the second
question of <em>uniqueness</em>, which makes each individual different
from others. Two layers of analysis are applied to uniqueness — the
<em>identification</em> of the uniqueness of personal identity at a set
time compared with other individual entities, and the
<em>continuity</em> of the person’s uniqueness over time.</p>
<h1 id="the-individuality-of-me">The Individuality of “Me”</h1>
<p>Aristotelianism portrays the “individual” as a distinct substance,
differentiated from accidents such as qualities, quantities, or
relations <span class="citation" data-cites="MetaphysicsZeta"></span>.
The substance of a human is the body. Each organ and system have their
own functions, yet they orchestrate to keep us alive. Unlike coral reef,
consisting of indistinct strands of polyps, the human body has a
generally clear physical boundary — the skin. Therefore, our body is a
discrete individual entity.</p>
<p>The concept of individuality expands beyond the biological dimension.
<span class="citation" data-cites="LockeHumanUnderstanding"></span>
ascribes personal identity to the continuity of consciousness, hinging
on memory. <span class="citation" data-cites="DavidHume"></span> sees
the self as a ever-changing “bundle” of perceptions or experience. <span
class="citation" data-cites="Mead1934MindSA"></span> defines identity by
social relations, which change over time as we forge new connections and
networks.</p>
<p>Our memory, experience and social relations, which are applied to
define our identity by the above philosophers, can’t exist independently
but are rather supported by the substance of our body, through which we
interact with the world. Our individuality is therefore a unity of
plurality, which comprises of biological, empirical and social
parameters. The analysis of individuality on all its parameters is
beyond the length of this essay. But since they are dependents of our
physical existence that are clearly delineated, this essay will move
from discussing discrete individuality of our substance to the
exploration of the uniqueness of each individual, and the possible
continuity of this uniqueness.</p>
<h1 id="the-uniqueness-of-me-and-its-continuity">The Uniqueness of “Me”
and its Continuity</h1>
<p>Canned tuna on shelves are individual identities but they are
practically not unique to the consumer. As long as they are still in the
shelf life, no one cares to take one can instead of another. There is
nothing particular about an industrial product that makes it stand out
from others mass produced or assembled at the same factory.</p>
<p>Each <em>person</em>, however, is unique in their biological
identity, empirical identity, and social identity. This essay explores
people’s unique characteristics through these three lens, and how they
are continued with the passage of time. I hereby propose that the
uniqueness of a person is preserved over time if the person’s unique
characteristics are preserved over time.</p>
<h2 id="biological-identity-and-its-continuity">Biological Identity and
Its Continuity</h2>
<p>“On average, the cells in your body are replaced every 7 to 10 years”
<span class="citation" data-cites="what-cells"></span>. Despite the
tempting but inaccurate interpretation that human bodies are renewed
every decade or so, there is significant constancy inside our body. For
example, most neurons do not regenerate. But even if all cells do, the
regeneration of our body’s <em>constituent parts</em> does not entail
that our biological <em>properties</em> change over time. Many
biological properties that are perceived to be identifying for
individuals, such as DNA sequence and fingerprints, generally stay
constant throughout our life. The wide application of fingerprints in
identifying people in user authentication and criminal investigations
suggests that fingerprints are unique and enduring.</p>
<p>The uniqueness of our biological system and the continuity of the
uniqueness are reinforced by the “Self/Non-self” theory by virologist
Sir Frank Burnet <span class="citation"
data-cites="BurnetFenner"></span>. The distinction of “self” from most
other entities elicits defensive responses against pathogens, the
tolerance of a graft from itself, and the rejection against grafts from
a donor organism in transplantation with few exceptions such as
isografts (grafts between identical twins) <span class="citation"
data-cites="pradeu2011limits"></span>. Adaptive immunological memory is
formed when specialized memory lymphocytes are produced, which would
trigger a more rapid and effective immune response on the next infection
by a pathogen with similar antigens. Adaptive immunity leaves a
long-term mark on our body; while COVID immunity lasts about 6 months,
smallpox immunity lasts for decades <span class="citation"
data-cites="Taub2008-ps"></span>. Therefore, my special immunity spans
over time due to the existence of immunological memory.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although most cells in our body regenerate constantly,
our biological identity does not change since it consists not in the
collection of components but in the properties that emerge therefrom.
The fact that our identity makers such as our DNA sequence,
fingerprints, and immunity transcend over time warrants the conclusion
that our biological identity spans diachronically.</p>
<h2 id="empirical-identity-and-its-continuity-memory">Empirical identity
and Its Continuity: Memory</h2>
<p><span class="citation" data-cites="LockeHumanUnderstanding"></span>
postulates the memory theory of identity. A person’s identity is tied to
their memory, i.e. their ability to recognize their past experiences as
their own, and to connect them to their present consciousness. Endel
Tulving further analyzes the concept of memory by distinguishing between
procedural memory (skills, e.g. muscle memory), semantic memory (factual
information) and episodic memory (personal experiences) <span
class="citation" data-cites="OutOfThePast"></span>.</p>
<p>Semantic memory as a whole rather than individual piece of factual
information contributes to identity. Many people can retrieve the
knowledge that Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo, and this does not
grant them identity because this piece of knowledge lacks uniqueness
that tells one person apart from another. However the assembly of
semantic memory of each person is still an idiosyncratic feature, since
one person may share some semantic memories with people of similar
educational background but it is unlikely that the entire knowledge
system of each person is identical. Though semantic memories are
constantly renewed by newly accumulated knowledge or attrition as time
goes by, the changing process is gradual. Moreover, the cognitive
structure underlying the acquired information, the critical thinking
cultivated by the analysis of those information, and the mindset of each
individual are relatively stable, as well as uniquely forged by each
person’s idiosyncratic assembly of semantic memories.</p>
<p>Locke’s theory appeals to episodic memories as a necessary condition
for uniqueness of individuals as well as sameness over time. “As far as
this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or
Thought, so far reaches the Identity of that Person; it is the same self
now it was then; and ’tis by the same self with this present one that
now reflects on it, that that Action was done” (Book II.xxvii.9).</p>
<p>This theory might be challenged from two perspectives. Firstly,
multiple people could have gone through the same events, and the shared
experience lacks uniqueness to individuals, hence absence of identity
since it is based on the premise of uniqueness as previously explained.
However, although different people may share the same episodes, they
were different agents in those moments and engaged from their own angles
respectively. Therefore, one’s memory of these episodes is still
distinct from that of others’.</p>
<p>The second and more common challenge to Locke’s memory theory is that
I may remember episodes of five years ago, and me of five years ago can
recall events of ten years ago, but the current me cannot recall most of
the life of ten years ago when I was a ignorant and happy kindergartner.
Am I still the same person of ten years ago? I would tackle this
question by the transitivity principle: if <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = <em>b</em></span> and <span
class="math inline"><em>b</em> = <em>c</em></span>, then <span
class="math inline"><em>a</em> = <em>c</em></span>. If I share the
identity of me from five years ago, and me of five years ago was still
the same person as the one of ten years ago, I and the one of ten years
ago still have the same identity on the principle of transitivity.</p>
<p>An exception would be rare cases of memory loss due to pathological
conditions in the brain. The loss of memory is a rupture in one’s life.
If that loss is significant enough to affect one’s personality, I argue
that they are not the same person.</p>
<p>Procedural memories are typically diachronically enduring — if we
have learned how to perform a skill in our childhood, the procedural
memory is carried on throughout our life. For example, even if we have
not touched bikes for ten years, once we get onto one, we can still ride
on like we have not stopped riding all these years. As in the case of
semantic memory, the assembly of procedural memories are also
idiosyncratic to each individual. These unique procedural memories stay,
without us being aware of it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the above analysis of semantic, episodic and procedural
memories suggests that what makes people unique and also identical with
themselves along the temporal axis is their remembering or being able to
remember the knowledge assembly, the episodes to which they were witness
or agent, and also the skills they acquire and stay. Personal identity
consists in memory.</p>
<h2 id="social-identity">Social identity</h2>
<p>Our identity is not only biologically and empirically determined, it
is also socially constructed.</p>
<p>According to <span class="citation"
data-cites="Mead1934MindSA"></span>, the self emerges from social
interactions. He divides the self into two components: the “me” and the
“I”. The “me” represents the organized set of attitudes of others that
the individual assumes. It’s the social self, the part of us that is
formed through interaction with others and with the social environment.
It embodies the expectations and norms of the community, allowing us to
predict how others will react to us. The “I” is the immediate response
of an individual to others. It is the spontaneous, unpredictable, and
creative part of the self. The “I” reacts to the “me”, and it’s through
this dialogue that we create meaning, make decisions, and ultimately
take action. So, for Mead, identity is continually created and recreated
through the social interactions we have, the roles we take on, and the
dialogue between the “I” and the “me”. Since social interactions are
dynamic, our identity is fluid rather than fixed.</p>
<p>However, the existence of the “me”, which embodies the attitudes,
roles, and rules assimilated from the social environment, provides a
consistent framework that guides behavior and thought. It ensures the
stability and continuity of our identity. Meanwhile, the elasticity of
social interactions allows us to grow inside the parameters of the
continuity of identity.</p>
<p>The impact of this continuity is huge. Its absence would translate
into lack of accountability for our own behavior and decision-making,
since we would not bear responsibility for our mistakes or crimes if we
could legitimately renew our identity every few years or months.
Property rights would be bygone and personal relationships chaotic since
filial, marital relationships vanished together with the continuity of
social identity.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>My identity emerges from my unique biological, empirical and social
properties. In my case, all three of these properties have continuously
developed since I was ten, but always with some constancy, be it the
preservation of the uniquely identifying biological characteristics, my
unique memory, or my our social identity shaped through social
interactions. I maintain my sense of self through time due to the
constancy in these properties. I am therefore intrinsically linked to
the ten-year-old child I was, biologically, empirically, and
socially.</p>
