		In sorrow deep I muse upon the fates,<br />
		That govern all our lives with iron hand,<br />
		For though we strive and struggle, we are slaves<br />
		To forces that our hearts can scarce withstand.
		</p>

		<p>
		The multiplicity of life we see,<br />
		Is but a shadow of a greater whole,<br />
		A tapestry whose threads we cannot be,<br />
		Of joy and pain, of birth and death, unfold.
		</p>

		<p>
		The path we tread, the choices that we make,<br />
		All lead us to a destiny divine,<br />
		A journey through life's maze, for our sake,<br />
		That we may learn, and grow, and intertwine.
		</p>

		<p>
		Yet still, we grieve, for what we cannot change,<br />
		And in our hearts, we feel the loss and pain,<br />
		For though our lives may seem but fleeting dreams,<br />
		They end in purpose, fate remains the same.
