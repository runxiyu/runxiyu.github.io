		<h1>Dream of the Whisker</h1>
		<p>Article ID: 12*</p>
<p>I scratched my paws on my face and whiskers—it hurts a bit, but I
know I’ll be healed soon. It’s yet another morning, in my
beautifully-decorated cage—full of bright lights, gleaming gold, and
endless piles of canned food. The steel bars on the sides have became
exceedingly cold. I looked outside, into a rather warm living room, by
the creatures who called themselves, <em>Homo sapiens</em>. Their
laughter comes into my left ear and out the right. Laughter—something
that I would never be able to experience with confidence. Crawling back
to my comfortable enclosure, I waited.</p>
<p>Usually, around this time the humans would deliver me water and milk,
along with opening some canned food for me to <em>enjoy</em> in my warm
and fluffy bed. "Children", namely young humans, would come and play
with me, often taking weird photos of me with what they call a "phone",
saying that I’m "cute". I honestly have no idea what these mean, but I
guess it’s nice that I could bring them some fun. Now it’s been a while
and they still haven’t came. My intuition tells me that something has
changed. Only now did I realize, that what I feared has been true, all
along.</p>
<p>Humans do not care about me—as a cat—as a fellow conscious creature.
I gazed off into the distant field, out side of their windows. Warm,
green, and endless. I imagined having a friend, a real friend, to enjoy
my last moments in this world, in the warm sunshine. I imagined freedom,
the freedom to walk outside this prison.</p>
<p>I was in my dreams when a cold hand grabbed me by the leg. I leaned
forward, trying to escape the iron grip. But all was futile. Everything
blurred into a point, full of misery, and full of pain. Screaming, I was
taken to a room. Blinded by the fluorescent lights atop the ceiling, I
have chosen to accept my fate. I turned away, twisting my paws strapped
onto the chair, my whiskers embedded in the soft cotton. I did not want
to witness it.</p>
<p>My heart begins to slow down. My heart beats the last beat, and my
neurons fire the last impulse. As I fall into the singularity of
entropy, time ceases to exist. The laws of physics have always been
eternal, but the universe—<em>my</em> universe—has became static and
never-changing. I now do not fear, I won’t fear <span>…</span> I
<em>cannot</em> fear.</p>
<p>I just wonder, what I have left behind.</p>
