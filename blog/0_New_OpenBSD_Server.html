		<h1>New OpenBSD server</h1>
		<p>I finally made the switch from <a href="https://debian.org">Debian&nbsp;GNU/Linux</a> to <a href="https://OpenBSD.org">OpenBSD</a> for my server.  I recently got into the idea that Linux is too bloated and was led the wrong direction.  OpenBSD on the other hand is well documented (you get help by reading the manual rather than searching the Web), secure by default, simpler, and not let by capital interests.</p>
		<p>Below I list a few articles that got me into this.  I do not agree with everything stated in these, but nevertheless they are a worth a lot to my technical thoughts.</p>
