Steps for updating your website

I'll be showing you how to do that with my website now, shouldn't be much different

Firstly, open up the directory you cloned.

I told you to git clone akhil@git.andrewyu.org:/var/www/git.andrewyu.org/akhil-www-pub, so you cd into ~/akhil-www-pub

I do that in my ~/www, since I don't have your website on my computer

I'm using the acme text editor for today, doesn't matter

When I use a red box to select text, that just means "execute this command"

cd www
git add .
git commit -m "added reference to haskell"
git push
