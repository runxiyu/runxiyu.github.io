		<h1>Andrew Yu's Life Log</h1>
		<p>Short ``fun facts'' in life.  Kind-of like your average ``social media'' blog, but without a manipulative algorithm in the middle and without political ideas (which should be discussed extensively, see my articles for these).</p>

		September 21, 2022: First week of school, or the first two weeks depending on how you see it, was nice.  Humanities are challenging, other classes are generally easy.  Food is good.  People are way too good at sports.  Gossip is excessive.
