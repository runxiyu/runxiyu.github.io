Abstract

   Free Software is undoubtably a good thing for society.  However,
   modern computer users are stuck in the proprietary "ecosystem" for
   historical reasons.  This document describes the author's viewpoint
   of using proprietary platforms to spread the ideas of Free Software.

Status of This Memo

   This document describes the author's viewpoint.  This does not
   represent the ideas of the Free Software Foundation or any other
   entity.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   Readers of this memo probably understand the ideals of the Free
   Software Movement, and avoid proprietary software when possible.
   However, as most outsiders are unaware and are deeply buried inside
   the proprietary dystopia created by mostly multibillion-dollar
   technology coorporations, our methods of communicating with the
   masses are ineffective.

   In February 2022, the author decided to adjust his dogma, and
   permitted limited usage of nonfree chat platforms to hopefully spread
   our ideas to the general public.  This was attempted by registering a
   Discord account, creating a Guild called "Free Software
   Introductions", and setting up a basic Discord-to-IRC relay to #fsi
   on both irc.andrewyu.org and irc.libera.chat.

                    Pragmatic Use of Nonfree Software         April 2022


   One of the communities that he knows about, the VF-Technic Minetest
   community, primarily uses Discord as a means of communication by
   plays not in-game.  As the users inside are Minetest players, a Free
   Software voxel sandbox game, similar to but much more flexible and
   freedom-respecting than Minecraft, it is believed that the users have
   some contact with Free Software, although they might not understand
   the freedom part of the issue, i.e. they might be thinking in terms
   of "open source" instead.  After sharing the invite link in the VF-
   Technic Guild, some people joined, and we've partially converted two
   users.

   Two users is definitely few, but it sets a start and an example for
   how freedom can be spread.

   There are numerous free replacements to proprietary services such as
   Discord, such as Internet Relay Chat, the Extensible Messaging and
   Presense Protocol, the Matrix protocol, and email.  As Free Software
   activists, we generally prefer these protocols over nonfree services.
   This section explains the reasons to consider nonfree services and
   protocols.

   Generally, users on IRC and XMPP have a fair understanding of the
   Free Software Movement, and it is quick and easy to inform them what
   we mean by "free", "the four freedoms", and similar ideas.  For users
   on the Libera Chat IRC network, which by far has the most users of
   any network, it is exceptionally easy to introduce a user into the
   #fsf channel for discussions with people supporting Free Software.
   Introducing ignorant users on these protocols and platforms are a
   day-to-day simple task.

   Furthermore, the amount of users we can reach on these protocols are
   rather limiting.  Libera has around forty thousand users according to
   the USERS command, and considering the fact that around 90% of these
   people aren't ignorant, there isn't much we can do.

   Matrix users, in particular users of the matrix.org homeserver,
   typically know but don't completely understand Free Software.  Rather
   than using Matrix IDs to identify users, the Matrix specification
   specifies that third-party platform identities, such as email and
   GitHub, are how users should be referenced both internally by servers
   and shown to other users.  This is obviously an increadibly foolish
   isea, especially considering the use of centralized identity servers
   (similar to X509 certificate authorities) for 3PIDs.  These are our
   first targets, but these should also be easy to get the idea across.

2.  The Plan

   But there is one special case where using some nonfree software, and
   even urging others to use it, can be a positive thing.  That's when
   the use of the nonfree software aims directly at putting an end to
   the use of that very same nonfree software.[RMSGP]
