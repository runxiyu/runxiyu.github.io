Abstract

   Free Software is undoubtably a good thing for society.  However,
   modern computer users are stuck in the proprietary "ecosystem" for
   historical reasons.  This document describes the author's viewpoint
   of using proprietary platforms to spread the ideas of Free Software.

Status of This Memo

   This document describes the author's viewpoint.  This does not
   represent the ideas of the Free Software Foundation or any other
   entity.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

1.  Introduction

   Readers of this memo probably understand the ideals of the Free
   Software Movement, and avoid proprietary software when possible.
   However, as most outsiders are unaware and are deeply buried inside
   the proprietary dystopia created by mostly multibillion-dollar
   technology coorporations, our methods of communicating with the
   masses are ineffective.

   In February 2022, the author decided to adjust his dogma, and
   permitted limited usage of nonfree chat platforms to hopefully spread
   our ideas to the general public.  This was attempted by registering a
   Discord account, creating a Guild called "Free Software
   Introductions", and setting up a basic Discord-to-IRC relay to #fsi
   on both irc.andrewyu.org and irc.libera.chat.
