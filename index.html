				<h2>Status of this website</h2>
				<p>I recently switched from GNU/Linux to OpenBSD on all of my servers and some desktop/laptops.  I'm going to rewrite the site soon, see you then!</p>
				<p>Things done:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>web</dt><dd>httpd, certbot, htaccess</dd>
					<dt>email</dt><dd>smtpd, dovecot, rspamd</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>I maintain a few sites on my server.</p>
				<dl>
					<dt>Public projects code on the Web</dt><dd><a href="https://project.andrewyu.org">https://projects.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
					<dt>Git bare repos for public projects</dt><dd><a href="https://git.andrewyu.org">https://git.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
					<dt>My personal blog</dt><dd><a href="https://blog.andrewyu.org">https://blog.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
					<dt>File storage space</dt><dd><a href="https://lib.andrewyu.org">https://lib.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<p>Note: Some of these sites are unpopulated.  Some of these sites look ugly.  Some of these sites don't exist yet.  This is, again, a new server, I'm probably going to fix that sooner or later.  If you still find it empty in a while, please tell me about that.  If you could get me a stylesheet that's high contrast but colorful, I'd appreciate that!  Just note that it's gotta be under a free license.  I'm not an expert in HTML and stuff, and I'm thinking of alternative protocols (including Gopher and Gemini, but I need to find sane UNIX-ey daemons).  I maintain the source of my website and blog on <a href="https://git.andrewyu.org">https://git.andrewyu.org</a> because I like hosting stuff myself as far as possible.</p>

				<h2>Help me ponder upon these questions</h2>
				<h3>Help me choose licenses</h3>
				<p>I am currently unable to decide what license should I choose for my programs and other works.  I used to use the GNU General Public License.  Then I realized that (1) the GPL causes compatibility problems with those who wish to use another [free] license (who do exist) and (2) the GPL restricts on what a user can do with a work.  I'm thinking of what freedom actually means---there are freedoms to do things and freedoms from being the object of some other person doing something.</p>
				<h3>What about a pure functional Lisp dialect, with monads and similar ideas?</h3>
				<p>I love s-expressions, as they clearly represent the structure of a program, or even natural language. (To be extended)</p>
				<h3>What about a mathematical politicol system?</h3>
				<p>(To be extended)</p>

			<div id="me">
				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I am Andrew Yu, a secondary school student in Shanghai, China.  My main fields of interest are philosophy (especially moral philosophy, and especially especially moral philosophy in technology), metamathematics, programming fundementals and molecular biology. (To be extended)</p>
			</div>
			<div id="contact">
				<h2>Contact</h2>
				<p>There are many ways to contact me.  None of these require proprietary software.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>talk to me in real life</li>
					<li>mail <a href="mailto:andrew@andrewyu.org">andrew@andrewyu.org</a></li>
					<li>irc <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/AndrewYu">Andrew on Libera</a></li>
					<li>irc <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/AndrewYu">Andrew on AndrewIRC</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>Note: I am not always on IRC until I get my bouncer set up.  AndrewIRC won't be up until I find a sane minimal server, then install and configure it.</p>
				<p>Caution: This server is quite new, and it seems to be in some dnsbl lists.  I'll try to get to you by other means if my email gets blocked.  Seems to be an issue with my reverse DNS, which I recently fixed.  We'll see.  Writing to me won't be affected though.</p>

			<p>This site is designed to be viewable with plain text, only a few typographic and web design conventions are followed. Do you agree that max-width: 75ex makes sense?  I do that since people have a hard time scanning scross lines.  Also, I use a monospace font because that's what I'm used to.  I prefer the Airbus B612Mono font, but I respect your preference by just saying font-family: monospace.  If you read this on a plain text browser like me, this won't matter, of course.  I'm also looking for a high-contrast colorful stylesheet.  As you can see, I did use some flexboxes in here.  They don't seem to respect min-width and max-width properly, especially min-wdith.  Tell me if you have a solution, thanks.</p>

			<p>I know that this website is not a program and that HTML isn't considered a programming language.  Nevertheless, you can think of the HTML as code---even the plain text I write could also be considered code since languages are a code to give information.  Anyways, stuff on here that's supposed to be public (don't try to spoof my htaccess, don't hack my ssh, don't snoop on my email, etc) is public domain, including my projects and my git repos, unless otherwise specified by a file that looks like COPYING, LICENSE or licensing stuff in the source itself. <a href="https://stpeter.im/writings/essays/publicdomain.html">https://stpeter.im/writings/essays/publicdomain.html</a> is a good explanation on why people put stuff in the public domain.  However, you might want to see the "Help me choose licenses" section on this page.</p>
