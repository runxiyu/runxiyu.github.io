				<h2><span class="alert">Project Help</span></h2>
				<p>Hello guys.  I currently need help with some of my projects.  If you can, please look in their repositories.  Any ideas would work.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://project.andrewyu.org/libresociety">The Libre Society Project</a> is a campaign to spread the ideas of <a href="https://fsf.org">free software</a> to places other than software, such as the political system, economics, and society in general.</li>
					<li><a href="https://project.andrewyu.org/librebiology">The Libre Biololgy Project</a> is a repository of ideas for the development of medicine and the treatment of patients, especially related to medical equity.  I haven't started on this one yet, but it is upcoming.</li>

				<h2>Help me ponder upon these questions</h2>
				<p>These are questions that interest me.  If I have more ideas on them, I might turn them into projects.</p>
				<h3>Sudden idea on the Lisp-like operating system</h3>
				<p>Emacs is an example!</p>
				<h3>Help me choose licenses</h3>
				<p>I am currently unable to decide what license should I choose for my programs and other works.  I used to use the GNU General Public License.  Then I realized that (1) the GPL causes compatibility problems with those who wish to use another [free] license (who do exist) and (2) the GPL restricts on what a user can do with a work.  I'm thinking of what freedom actually means&mdash;there are freedoms to do things and freedoms from being the object of some other person doing something.  Does software which you can't distribute in any form you wish count as free software?  I think so.  However, as <a href="https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-problems-with-the-gpl.html">https://unixsheikh.com/articles/the-problems-with-the-gpl.html</a> explains, the GPL is based on coercing people into sharing, but coercion not effective in any field to make people actually share.  This is understandable.  I might start using the GPL again for my programs (might even be the AGPL).  However, you might wanna convince me (if you have good arguments on this) to use a license for my documents and books&mdash;I put them into the public domain, and I think that's okay.  Please mail me if you have any thoughts on this.  But sad examples:  Minix was permissively licensed, got abused by Intel.  The BSD stuff was permissively licensed, got abused by Apple.</p>
				<h3>What about a pure functional Lisp dialect, with monads and similar (Haskell) ideas?</h3>
				<p>I love s-expressions, as they clearly represent the structure of a program, or even natural language.  They also allow for powerful macros, enabling some Lisp dialects to have continuations and other cool stuff.  Haskell, on the other hand, is purely functional, where things that involve side effects are usually implemented with Monads.  I'm looking for an implementation that combines these.</p>
				<h3>What about a mathematical political system?</h3>
				<p>A government too strong causes authoritarianism which may lead to non-democracies, while a government too weak causes the inability of the government to do anything with the slightest controversy (look at COVID handling).  Is there a mathematical way (say a function; this sounds like group theory, but I'm not sure) to compute, based all known information known about the bill/order/whatever being considered, if the government (I'm especially talking about the executive here) has the right to order that? I feel like this could be proved impossible due to incompleteness and unpredictability, but this needs further investigation.</p>

				<p>Caution: This server is quite new, and it seems to be in some dnsbl lists.  I'll try to get to you by other means if my email gets blocked.  Seems to be an issue with my reverse DNS, which I recently fixed.  We'll see.  Writing to me won't be affected though.</p>

			<p>This site is designed to be viewable with plain text, only a few typographic and web design conventions are followed. Do you agree that max-width: 75ex makes sense?  I do that since people have a hard time scanning scross lines.  Also, I now use a sans font because some people have trouble reading monospace.  I prefer the Airbus B612Mono and B612 fonts, but I respect your preference by just saying font-family: sans-serif.  If you read this on a plain text browser like me, this won't matter, of course.  I'm also looking for a high-contrast colorful stylesheet.  As you can see, I did use some flexboxes in here.  They don't seem to respect min-width and max-width properly, especially min-wdith.  Tell me if you have a solution, thanks.</p>

			<p>I know that this website is not a program and that HTML isn't considered a programming language.  Nevertheless, you can think of the HTML as code&mdash;even the plain text I write could also be considered code since languages are a code to give information.  Anyways, stuff on here that's supposed to be public (don't try to spoof my htaccess, don't hack my ssh, don't snoop on my email, etc) is public domain, including my projects and my git repos, unless otherwise specified by a file that looks like COPYING, LICENSE or licensing stuff in the source itself. <a href="https://stpeter.im/writings/essays/publicdomain.html">https://stpeter.im/writings/essays/publicdomain.html</a> is a good explanation on why people put stuff in the public domain.  However, you might want to see the "Help me choose licenses" section on this page.</p>
