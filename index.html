				<p>It is our responsibility to spread <a href="https://fsf.org">free software</a>, <a href="https://fcm.andrewyu.org">free computing (one of the websites started by me :D)</a> and advocate for user freedom.  Please don't waste any chances to do so.</p>

			<div id="majornote">
				<p>Most of my new articles are available at the Request for Discussions Website.  Older ones will be republished there.</p>
				<p>As there's a lot of stuff with school, etc. going around, I'm currently inactive on writing articles and stuff.  I have many recent ideas, and I'll turn them into RFDs when I have time.  (Secondary school in China is some work, really, compared with many other places.)</p>

				<blockquote><p>Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different from saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. &mdash;Edward Snowden</p></blockquote>

				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I am Andrew Yu.  My main fields of interest are philosophy (especially moral philosophy, and especially especially moral philosophy in technology), metamathematics, programming fundamentals and molecular biology.  I'm also a free software activist.</p>

				<h2>Contact</h2>
				<p>There are many ways to contact me.  None of these require proprietary software.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>talk to me in real life (This method is preferred, if you know me in real life.);</li>
					<li>mail <a href="mailto:andrew@andrewyu.org">andrew@andrewyu.org</a> (Emails are preferred for in-depth discussions.);</li>
					<li>xmpp <a href="xmpp:andrew@andrewyu.org">andrew@andrewyu.org</a> (My OTR fingerprint is <code>D860F6CC FEF3D079 A6964AA3 86BD6A34 8F86E218</code> and my OpenPGP fingerprint is as below.  Use this for quick questions, or highly interactive discussions.).</li>
					<li>irc <a href="irc://irc.andrewyu.org:6697/Andrew">Andrew</a> on <a href="https://irc.andrewyu.org">LibreIRC</a> (LibreIRC is an IRC network started by Andrew, myself, running Solanum IRCd and Atheme Services. Use this for quick questions, or highly interactive discussions.  Since talking on Internet Relay Chat requires people to be online at the same time, use a bouncer, or don't close your client, to ensure that my replies reach you.  Of course you can also give me another way to get to you that's persistent.);</li>
					<li>irc <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/Andrew">Andrew</a> on <a href="https://libera.chat">Libera</a> (Libera is an IRC network popular among free software users, activists and developers.  Use this for quick questions, or highly interactive discussions.  Please note that for privacy purposes, you should use some type of encryption.  I am not affiliated with Libera and I don't run it in any way.  Of course, either be on there all the time or give me another way to contact you.).</li>
				</ul>
				<p>There are many ways <em>not</em> to contact me.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>WeChat is deprecated and unsupported.  I only keep an account for school and use Mojo-Weixin to relay it to IRC.  If you're also bothered by the mandatory usage of these software at school, sign <a href="https://my.fsf.org/give-students-userfreedom">the give students user freedom petition by the FSF</a>;</li>
