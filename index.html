		<h1>Andrew Yu's WIP website</h1>
		<p>I recently switched from Linux to OpenBSD on all of my servers and some desktop/laptops.  I'm going to rewrite the site soon, see you then!</p>
		<p>Things done:</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>web</dt><dd>httpd, certbot, htaccess</dd>
			<dt>email</dt><dd>smtpd, dovecot, rspamd</dd>
		</dl>
		<h2>Sites</h2>
		<p>I maintain a few sites on my server.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Public projects code on the Web</dt><dd><a href="https://project.andrewyu.org">https://projects.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
			<dt>Git bare repos for public projects</dt><dd><a href="https://git.andrewyu.org">https://git.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
			<dt>My personal blog</dt><dd><a href="https://blog.andrewyu.org">https://blog.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
			<dt>File storage space</dt><dd><a href="https://lib.andrewyu.org">https://lib.andrewyu.org</a></dd>
		</dl>
		<p>Note: Some of these sites are unpopulated.  Some of these sites look ugly.  Some of these sites don't exist yet.  This is, again, a new server, I'm probably going to fix that sooner or later.  If you still find it empty in a while, please tell me about that.</p>
		<h2>Contact</h2>
		<p>There are many ways to contact me.  None of these require proprietary software.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>talk to me in real life</li>
			<li>mail <a href="mailto:andrew@andrewyu.org">andrew@andrewyu.org</a></li>
			<li>irc <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/AndrewYu">Andrew on Libera</a></li>
			<li>irc <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat:6697/AndrewYu">Andrew on AndrewIRC</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Note: I am not always on IRC until I get my bouncer set up.  AndrewIRC won't be up until I find a sane minimal server, then install and configure it.</p>
		<p>Caution: This server is quite new, and it seems to be in some dnsbl lists.  I'll try to get o you by other means if my email gets MX-bounced.</p>
